    about: '<p>Often you would notice that a piece of news breaks out in the market and immediately there is a sharp reaction in the share price of a company/ companies. Sometimes the news has a direct impact on the operations of a company but sometimes the news may have far reaching indirect impact which is difficult to gauge.
