    %b Monitoring:
    Investment performance varies over time. Investment that performed
    well in one year may perform poorly in the following year. This is true especially
    of cyclical stocks and interest rate sensitive bonds. Market conditions change over
    time and influence investment returns. Therefore, it is not necessary that a stock/bond
    that is a good investment today will continue to be a good investment two years
    from now.
  %p
    Investors should monitor their portfolios and changing market conditions. The portfolio
    should be regularly valued at prevailing market prices so that its performance can
    be measured. Strict risk limits should be set and appropriate risk management techniques
    should be used to limit exposure to unwanted risks.
  %p
    %b Rebalancing
    is the process of restoring portfolio component weights to their
    target weights when they change significantly.

    Example: Suppose Rahul decides that his portfolio will comprise 60% of equity
    and 40% of realty. In August 2008, he invests Rs.6000 in a mutual fund tracking
    the BSE Sensex and Rs.4000 in a realty mutual fund tracking
    the BSE Realty index. Suppose in August 2009, he finds that
    his equity mutual fund holdings are valued at Rs.10000 and that his realty mutual
    fund holdings are valued at Rs.4500. His portfolio now consists of 69% equity
    and 31% realty.

  %p
    In order to restore his portfolio to its original asset weights, he would sell Rs.1300
    worth of his equity holdings and invest the returns in a realty mutual fund.
    His new portfolio would consist of Rs.8700 worth of equity and Rs.5800 worth of
    realty.
