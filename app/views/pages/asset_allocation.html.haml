  %p
    An asset is anything that is expected to provide positive cashflow in the future.
    This is a rather broad definition and thus encompasses securities (e.g. stocks,
    bonds), real estate (e.g. land, houses), intellectual property (e.g. copyrights,
    patents) etc.
  %p
    Asset classes are sets of assets that have similar features and behave similarly.
    Securities of one asset class will generally be subject to similar regulations since
    they exhibit similar characteristics. The main asset classes are – Equity (stocks),
    Fixed Income Securities (bonds etc), Commodities (gold, silver, oil, wheat etc),
    Cash Equivalents (short term deposits, money market instruments) and real estate.
    Some analysts go one step further and have narrower definitions of asset classes
    resulting in asset classes such as – Large cap domestic stocks, international stocks,
    mid cap domestic stocks, non-gold commodities etc.

  %h1 Types of Assets and Varying Risk-Return Profiles:
  =image_tag  "investment_education/assetallocation1.png", :height => "150px", :width => "200px"
  %p Different assets carry different risks and yield different returns.
  %p
    1)Money market instruments are known as cash
    equivalents as they are extremely liquid (can be converted to cash very easily).
    They yield the lowest returns amongst all asset classes as they also carry the least risk.

  %p
    2)Bonds, carry more risk than money market instruments.
    Bonds are long-term instruments (less liquid) and carry default risk i.e. the risk
    that the bond-issuer will not be able to make interest/principal payments. Bonds
    are also subject to inflation risk (the risk that inflation will be more than expected)
    and interest rate risk (the risk of change interest rates adversely affecting bond
    prices).
  %p
    Since bonds are riskier than cash equivalents, they yield higher returns. If they
    didn’t , investors wouldn’t have an incentive to invest in bonds and would rather
    invest in cash equivalents.
  %p
    3) Equity(Stocks)
    are substantially riskier than bonds.
    Stock holders only have a right to the residual income/assets of the issuing company
    after all bond-holders and creditors have been paid. Therefore, the bondholder can
    be considered “senior” to the share holder. To illustrate the concept of seniority,
    let us consider the following: Under normal circumstances, the bondholder will be
    paid his original investment and promised interest as long as the bondholder holds
    the bond until maturity.

  %p
    Let us assume that a firm is facing bankruptcy and is liquidated. Proceeds from
    liquidation will first go to the bondholders and the remaining sum, if any, will
    go to share holders. However in most cases of bankruptcy, bondholders will get less
    than their initial investment and the share holders will usually end up with nothing.
  %p
    Share prices also depend heavily on market sentiment; corporate earnings etc are
    a lot more volatile than bond prices. Equities reward investors for taking on all
    these risk with higher returns than bonds.

  %h1 Asset Allocation:
  %p
    Asset Allocation is the process by which the total investible capital of the portfolio
    is distributed across different asset classes. As discussed in the previous article,
    asset classes are sets of assets that behave similarly and have similar characteristics,
    e.g. stocks, fixed income securities, commodities and cash (cash equivalents).
  %p
    Investors typically do not invest all their money in one asset class or one single
    security. This is done for the sake of diversification benefits.
  %p
    An investor’s asset allocation should be performed based on:
    %ol
      %li The investor’s investment goals and needs
      %li The investor’s risk profile
      %li The investor’s unique constraints.
      %li Tax regime
      %li Investor’s Time horizon
  %p
    As discussed in the article on tax planning, tax structures also influence asset
    allocation. Equities are preferred in countries with high tax rates as taxes typically
    apply only to dividend income and realized capital gains.Tax drag can be minimized
    by deferring the realization of capital gains. Tax structures and tax drag are discussed here
    %p
    A study found that up to 90% of the return of portfolios can be explained simply
    by asset allocation (as opposed to market timing or other factors). Thus, in the
    opinion of most experts, asset allocation is the single most important part of portfolio
    management.
