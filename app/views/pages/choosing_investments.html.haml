  %h1 Security Selection:
  %p
    The exact mix of a portfolio’s capital allocated to different asset classes is decided
    in the asset allocation stage. The next
    step consists of selecting which securities to invest in and how much to invest
    in each security. This is called security selection. Securities could be individual
    stocks, bonds, commodities, mutual funds, ETFs etc.
  %p
    For example, let us assume that a portfolio consists of Rs.100,000 of capital and
    that we have determined during the asset allocation stage that 10% will be allocated
    to international stocks, 20% to large-cap domestic stocks, 30% to mid and small
    cap stocks, 30% to corporate bonds and 10% to cash. This implies that the amount
    of money allocated to each asset class is:

  %p
    The next step is to decide which large-cap stocks will take up the Rs.20,000 allocated
    to this asset class and in what proportion and so on. The process of making that
    decision is called security selection.
    %br/
    Investors could invest passively in ETFs/Mutual funds tracking major indices or
    invest in individual stocks/bonds. That decision is influenced by the investor’s
    perceptions of his skill, of market efficiency etc.

  %h1 Business Cycles:
  %p
    It is critically important to keep in mind business cycles while analyzing markets
    and securities. A term that is widely used to describe the swings between economic
    booms and busts is “business cycle”. Simultaneous price movements in multiple securities
    may reflect current market sentiments. Every business cycle typically lasts between
    seven years to ten years or more and it is characterised by stages of recession,
    recovery, early upswing, late stage upswing or boom.
  %p
    A “bubble” is a term used to describe an economy/market that is growing at an unsustainable
    rate. This occurs when the economy is reaching its peak in terms of the current
    capacity to consume. Another term to describe this is “overheating”. Typical characteristics
    of such an economy include rising interest rates, rising asset prices, and stock
    market volatility. Finally, this bubble will burst and the economy plunges into
    recession.

    1. Aggressive Strategies:
    %br/
    Investors pursuing aggressive strategies tend to make relatively risky investments
    that are expected to yield high returns. The portfolio will typically hold a large
    amount of high-risk securities such as equities and derivatives such as futures
    and options.

  %p
    2.Defensive Strategy
    The objective of such a strategy is to minimize overall portfolio risk. Investors
    pursuing such strategies are generally risk-inverse and they tend to focus on high
    grade corporate debt and high- dividend yield stock of large companies in the finance
    and utilities sectors.

  %p
    3.Balanced Strategy
    %br/
    A balanced portfolio is usually aimed at balancing risks and returns. This portfolio
    promises some returns, though not as high as those of an aggressive portfolio. A
    balanced portfolio carries higher risks than a defensive portfolio but lower risks
    than an aggressive portfolio. Such a portfolio carries a relatively equal mix of
    bonds/cash equivalents and equities.

  %h1 There are several approaches to valuing securities:

    %b Fundamental Analysis
    \:Fundamental Analysis involves assessing companies based on fundamental factors such as financial health, industry outlook, competitive advantage and quality of management.
  %p
    Fundamental analysts are typically holistic when they value the security. For example, in valuing a stock, analysts will analyse factors such as the future direction of the economy, the potential growth of the industry it belongs to, the operational efficiency of the company management, the competitiveness of the company strategies, etc.
